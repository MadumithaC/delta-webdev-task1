Problem Statement
Deep Bhattacharyya is an elite programmer, and hence needs to manage his time to perfection. He’s currently caught up with a busy intern, and has to manage his Open Source contributions as well. How will he find time to tend to all of his mentees?! He turns to you for help!

Build him a webpage where he can manage all his mentees, give them ratings, and write comments about their progress.

Normal Mode

Allow a mentor to add mentees to a list of mentees.

Each mentee will have their own box dedicated for them where the mentor can add a rating and add comments in a text field.

Allow mentors to edit and delete mentee profiles.

Hacker Mode

Make your webpage presentable with some styling, and make it responsive to screen size (mobile-compatible)

Based on the ratings provided by the mentor, the background color of the box varies from red to green.

Have a sort button to sort mentees based on their rating.

Implement saving to local storage, so that the information remains even when the page is refreshed.

Mentee boxes should be in a compact form at first, displaying only the name and rating. When clicked, the mentee box should expand revealing all details. When another mentee box is clicked the first one collapses and the new one expands.

Submission
Submission will be to your mentors. You can ask them any questions you may have.

Normal Mode is required. Hacker mode is very highly encouraged.

Submission Deadline - Friday, May 18th

Required Skills
You’ll need to learn basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript for this task. The main concept you’ll be using is DOM manipulation.

Refer to the Beginner’s guide that was posted for more resources.

Limitations
You are not allowed to use any frameworks, like jQuery, Angular, Bootstrap, or React. The code must be in Vanilla JS only. You also don’t require a backend, and you shouldn’t need to make one.

Deep needs your help.
Good luck and happy coding!
